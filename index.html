            <h3>
              <u><strong> A brief history of Nelson Mandela </strong></u>
            </h3>
          </center>
          <p>
            Known and loved around the world for his commitment to peace,
            negotiation and reconciliation, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was South
            Africa's first democratically elected president (1994-1999). Mandela
            was an anti-apartheid revolutionary and political leader, as well as
            a philanthropist with an abiding love for children. Mandela was born
            into the Xhosa royal family on 18 July 1918 and died on 5 December
            2013. Before his death in 2013 at the age of 95, the former
            President of South Africa, led an extraordinary life. From 25 years
            of imprisonment, to becoming the first democratically elected
            President of his nation and jointly winning the Nobel Peace
            Prize.<br />

            In his 1994 autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom Mandela describes
            how education intertwined the different events in his life. He
            discusses the Western-style English-language education he received
            at mission schools as a boy, and how the feelings of inadequacy it
            fostered among his people resulted in anger and even social
            uprising: “it was not lack of ability that limited my people, but
            lack of opportunity… We were taught that the …best men were
            Englishmen.” <br />

            Throughout his long life and even his imprisonment, Mandela made a
            point to keep educating himself – seeing learning as an escape from
            his confines. Even just days before the trial at which he could have
            been served a death sentence, he was writing papers for his law
            degree.<br />

            He even inspired his fellow prisoners to do the same: “At night, our
            cell block seemed more like a study hall than a prison… Robben
            Island was known as ‘the University’ […] because of what we learnt
            from each other”.

              <u><strong> Few achievements of Nelson Mandela </strong></u>
            </h3>
          </center>
          <p>
            This is a comprehensive list of awards, honours and other
            recognitions bestowed on Nelson Mandela. Mandela received more than
            260 awards over 40 years, most notably the Nobel Peace Prize in
            1993. From 1994 to 1999, Mandela was President of South Africa. He
            was the first such African to be elected in fully representative
            democratic polls. <br />

            Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, his advocacy
            of a policy of reconciliation and negotiation helped lead the
            transition to multi-racial democracy in South Africa. Since the end
            of apartheid, he was widely praised, even by former opponents.
            <br />

            In South Africa he is often known as Madiba, an aristocratic title
            adopted by the elderly members of the royal clan that he belongs to.
            This title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela. <br />
